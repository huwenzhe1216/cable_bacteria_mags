## cable_bacteria_mags
The eight files with the suffix 'gz' are cable bacteria MAGs obtained from sediments of salt lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). They have also been deposited in the NCBI database with accession numbers JALAAF000000000 to JALAAM000000000 under the BioProject number PRJNA787663.


## QTP.cable.bacteria.16SrRNA.fa
The file "QTP.cable.bacteria.16SrRNA.fa" are 16S rRNA gene sequences of these cable bacteria MAGs. MATAM v1.6.0 (Pericard et al. 2018) was used to reconstruct the 16S rRNA marker gene sequences directly from metagenomic short sequencing reads. MarkerMAG v1.1.26 (Song et al. 2022) were used to establish links between putative CB MAGs and the corresponding 16S rRNA gene sequences. Six of the eight cable bacterial MAGs were linked to 16S rRNA marker genes.
